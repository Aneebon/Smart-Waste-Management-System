♻ Smart Waste Management System A Smart AI-Powered Waste Management System built during a hackathon to automate waste segregation, track bin status in real time, and foster community participation via a waste exchange platform.

🚀 Project Overview This project introduces an AI-integrated smart dustbin that automates trash sorting, monitors fill levels, and displays real-time data on a web dashboard. In addition, the system features an AI-powered waste exchange platform to enable recycling, reuse, and circular economy practices in local communities.
